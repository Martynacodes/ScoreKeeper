# ScoreKeeper
This score keeper widget can be used for any two player game to keep score. Each player has a button to add points. There is a possibility to select what we wish to play up to( in this demo case, the maximum score is 11 as in ping pong).

The winning score changes color to green and the lost score changes color to red at the end of the game. There is a reset button as well to start again.
